then croffed Skuylkil, and rode along the weft fide over rich bottoms, after which we afcended the Flying Hill, (fo called from the great number of wild Turkeys that ufed to fly from them to the plains) here we had a fine profpect of the Blue Mountains, and over the rich Vale of Tulpebocken; the defcent into which was fteep and ftony.<br /> <br />Through this vale we travelled weft, and by the way observed a large fpring 16 feet deep, and above 20 yards wide, which iffued out of a limestone rock, the ground above it pretty level, defending gradually towards the fpring which ran eaftward.<br /> <br />At at night we lodged at Conrad Weifers, who is the general Interpreter, and who went with us; his bufinefs was to fettle an affair with the Indians at Onondago.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\">The 5<sup>th</sup>, We croffed Tulpebocken Creek which runs eaft, and emptieth itfelf into the Skuylkil, and a little after a fmall branch of Swataro which runs Weft into Sufquehanah.<br /> <br />Thefe two large creeks receive moft of the water of that great rich vale between the Flying Hill and Tulpebocken Hill, from which the vale and creek receive their names, and is itfelf fo called from the Indian word fignifying a tortoife, unto which the natives of the country have conceived it bears fome fimilitude.<br /> <br />And thefe two hills are the fouthern boundary of this fine limeftone vale, many hundred miles long, and from 10 to 20 miles broad to the northern boundary formed by the Great Blue Mountains. Having called on a man who was to go with us and carry part of our provifions to Shamokin, he could not get his horfe fhod that day, but we rode to William Parfons's plantation, who received and entertained us very kindly; his houfe is about fix miles from the Blue Mountains.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\">The 6<sup>th</sup>, we fet forward and afcended the firft Blue ridge, from the top of which we made an obfervation, Conrad Weifers Hill bearing fouth 20 degrees eaft, the northern profpect to two gaps, thro' which we were to pafs to the North Hill, N. 30 deg. W. about 10 miles diftant. The top and fouth fide of this ridge is midling land, half a quarter of a mile broad, and produced fome wild grafs, abundance of <Modal modal={words.fern} />, <Modal modal={words.oak} />, and <Modal modal={words.chefnut} /> trees. Defcending the North fide we found it more poor, fteep and ftony, and come foon to the firft branch of Swataro which runs between the ridges, and is 3 miles from the next branch, all very poor land; but on this fecond branch, it is good low land, with large trees of 5 leaved <Modal modal={words.whitePine} />, <Modal modal={words.poplar} />, and <Modal modal={words.whiteOak} />, here we dined by a fpruce fwamp.<br /><br />After dinner we paffed the openings of two ridges, the laft of which was by the bank of the principal branch of Swataro, the foil poor and ftoney; then we afcended a great ridge about a mile fteep, and terribly ftoney moft of the way: near the top is a fine tho' fmall fpring of good water. At this place we were warned by a well known alarm to keep our diftance from an enranged rattle fnake that had put himfelf into a coiled pofture of defence, within a dozen yards of our path, but we punifhed his rage by ftriking him dead on the fpot: he had been highly irritated by an <Modal modal={words.indianDog} /> that barked eagerly at him, but was cunning enough to keep out of his reach, or nimble enough to avoid the fnake when he fprung at him. We took notice that while provoked, he contracted the mufcles of his cales fo as to appear very bright and fhining, but after the mortal ftroke, his fplendor became much diminifhed, this is likewife the cafe of many of our fnakes. The north fide of the Hill is not ftony as the fouth, but yet very poor. Thence we traveled 7 miles over feveral hollows, fwamps and fmall ridges, full of fcrubby bufhes, and ftill poor and ftoney to the laft great ridge, which is compofed chiefly of large gravel, as big as pidgeons or pullets eggs, and even the rocks feemed but heaps of the fame materials; the defcent on the north fide is very fteep and rocky, large craggy rocks are difpofed on all fides, moft part of the way down, which brought us to a fine vale, where we lodged by a creek called Saurel, and were grievoufly ftung all night with fmall gnats, fo that I flept very little.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\">The 7<sup>th</sup>, we let out weft from Saurel creek and traveled down the vale, which is pretty good land: and leaving the creek, foon croffed another runing along the north fide of the vale, by the bank of which we rode through a grove of white Pine, very lofty and fo clofe, that the Sun could hardly fhine through; at the end of this the two branches joined. Riding a little farther, we paffed through a gap of a moderate hill, north by the creek fide, where we found a fifhing place, moftly a deep hole near a rock; there we went weft on the north fide of the creek, and dined at what is called the Double Eagle. The land hereabouts is middling white oak and <Modal modal={words.huckleberry} /> land, and by the creek fides pretty good wild graft, and the 2d branch enters about 30 rood below; having croffed this, we went up a vale of middling foil, covered with high oak Timber, nearly weft to the top of the hill, (moft of the way being a white clay under a fhallow furface), where we firft obferved the impreffion of fhells in fome of the loofe ftones, and from whence we had a fair profpect of the river Sufquehanah.<br /> <br />The defcent from hence foon brought us to Mohony, our lodging for this night. Here the foil is very good throughout the neck, formed by the river and the creek, which is about 3     poles wide. It rained this night through our old, tho’ newly erected lodging, which was an Indian Cabin that we took the liberty to remove, knowing they ufually leave behind them a good flock of fleas on the ground they inhabit; however, the wet deprived me of my reft that I had taken fo much pains to fecure againft the vermin.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\">July 8. We croffed the creek and rode along a rich bottom near the river for two miles, producing moft kinds of our foreft trees, and a large fpecies of <Modal modal={words.scuteleria} /> two feet high: thence along the river fide, near a mile N. 20 deg. E. to the foot of a fertil hill, where leaving the river our way N. E. though feveral narrow valleys and over small hills, generally middling land, yielding oak, <Modal modal={words.hickory} />, chefnut, and fome pine, to the fummit of a high hill, where we faw Shamokin Hill, diftant four miles only; going down we came to uneven fony ground producing <Modal modal={words.pitchPine} /> and oak, as far as the point of Shamokin Hill, whence we had a pleafant profpect of the fall of the river, quite crofs without any great Rocks. The ftream runs very fwift, but canoes or flat-bottomed boats may go up or down well enough: the bottom of this defcent is wafhed by Shamokin Creek three rods wide, this we forded to a fruitful bottom half a mile wide, beyond which two miles good oak land brought us to the town of Shamokin. It contains eight cabbins near the river's bank right oppofite the mouth of the weft branch that interlocks with the branches of Allegheny. It is by means of this neighbourhood that we may reafonably hope, when thefe parts fhall be better known, that a very beneficial Trae may be extended through the Hokio into the Miffiffippi and its branches among the numerous nations that inhabit their banks. It wew to be withed, that the Englifh government in thefe parts had been more diligent in fearching and furveying the heads of their own rivers and he fources of the others that run weftwards from the backs of their refective provinces. Yet enough is already known to juftify the furmifes of Mr. de la Sale, who in his Journal addreffed to the Count de Frontenac expreffes his fears, left the Englifh, from their fettlements, fhould poffefs themfelves of the trade on the Miffiffippi. I quartered in a trader's cabbin, and about midnight the Indian came and called up him and his fquaw, who lay in a separate part of the goods were depofited, whether together or no I did not ask. She fold the Indian rum, with which being qickly intoxicated, men and women began firft to fing and then dance around the fire; then the women would run out to other cabbins and foon return, leaving the men finging and dancing the war dance, which continued all the next day. An Englifhman when very drunk will fall faft afleep for the moft part, but an Indian, when merry, falls to dancing, running, and fhouting, which violent action probably may difperfe the fumes of the liquor, that had he fat ftill or remained quiet, might have made him drowfy, and which it even carries of by continued agitation.<br /> <br />As foon as we alighted they fhowed us where to lay our baggage, and then brought us a bowl of boiled fquathes cold; this I then thought poor entertainment, but before I came back I had learnt not to defpife good Indian food. This hofpitality is agreeable to the honeft fimplicity of ancient times, and is fo punctully adhered to, that not only what is already dreffed is immediately fet before a traveller, but the moft preffing bunifets is poftponed to prepare the beft they can get for him, keeping it as a maxim that he muft always be hungry, of this we found the good effects in the fleth and bread they got ready for us.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> July 9, After breakfast Lewis Evans and myfelf went to the point of the mountain clofe to the N.E. branch, a mile and a half up the river from our lodging, and good level rich land all the way; we walked thither, carrying our blankets with us, and flept near three hours. Here we regulated our journey, and having taken a pleafant view of the range of mountains, and the charming plane of Shamokin, 2 miles long and above one broad, skirted on the Weft and North by the river, and encompaffed Eaft, and partly South, with lofty hills, befides a fine vale bordering the North Weft branch, we returned to the town and fined. In the afternoon we borrowed a canoe, and paddled up the Weft branch. It is near two-thirds as broad as the North Eaft or main river: I went afhore on the fouth fide to the point of a hill to look for curiofities, but found none; the rock confifted of a dark colored thelly ftone: Then we diverted our felves with fwimming, the water was chin deep moft of the breadth, and fo clear one might have feen a pin at the bottom. At night I hung up my blanket like a hammock, that I might lay out of the reach of the fleas,  troublefome and conftant guefts in an Indian hut; but I found my contrivance too cool for a place open on all fides, tho covered with a kind of granary, efpecially the wind blowing cold from the N. W.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 10. We departed in the morning with Shickalamy and his fon, he being the chief man in the town, which confifted of Delaware Indians; he was of the fix nations, or rather a Frenchman, born at Montreal, and adopted by the Oneidoes, after being taken prifoner; but his son told me he was of the Cayuga nation, that of his mother, agreeable to the Indian rule Partus fequitur ventrem, which is as reafonable among them as among cattle, fince the whole burthen of bringing up falls on her; therefore in cafe of feparation the children fall to her thare.<br /> <br />We had many advantages from the company of thefe guides, were perfectly acquainted with that part of the country, and being of the fix Nations they were both a credit and protection; and, alfo as we went to accommodate the differences, and allay the Heart-burnings that had been raifed by a late skirmish on the back of Virginia between fome of thefe nations and the Englifh, we could not but derive a confidence from the company of a chief.<br /> <br />We coafted the river near a mile to the ford, where we had a good bottom not above 3 feet deep; this brought us to an Ifland near 2 miles long and a quarter broad, pretty rich at the lower end, and near the river, but the higher end fandy, from the drifted left there by the floods, it therefore produces little but pitch pine. After leaving the lower end where we faw feveral cabbins, we once more took water for the oppofite fhore, but the bottom is lefs even, though not above half as wide as the laft, which is about 400 yards.<br /><br />Hence leaving the weft branch about half a mile on our left, and rich low ground between with gravel, oak and pintch-pine land on our right, we reached a pretty fpring of good water, fituated between the fwamp and dry ground. This, fince our paffage over the Blue Mountain was the only one we met with till we came near Onondago, for on that fide the currents and creeks are chiefly formed by the water oufing and draining from the bottoms of the mountains and hills, and are gradually collected in this manner into rivulets. But on the fouth of this great ridge, it gufhes out between the rockets in ftreams big enough to turn a mill, in other places rifing and bubbling out of the earth in quantity fuufficient to fill a pipe an inch fquare, or thereabout.<br /> <br />Our journey now lay through very rich bottoms to a creek 6 miles from Shamokin, a great extent of fruitful low ground ftill continuing. Here we found a fine meadow of grafs on our right, and rich dry ground on the left. In our path lay a large Rattle fnake, but he civilly crept into the grafs, and let us pafs without danger. Our way from hence lay through an old Indian field of excellent foil, where there had been a town, the principal footfteps of which are  <Modal modal={words.peachTrees} />, plumbs and excellent grapes. A great flood came down this branch a few years paft, and drove abundance of fand over this ground a great depth among the trees. It rofe 20 feet perpendicular, wathing away many yards of the bank, which was compofed of gravel and fand, and doubtlefs had been raifed to that heighth by former inundations, for the wood ground 30 rod from the river is feveral feet lower than the bank; a little above this devaftation we dined.<br /> <br />And now leaving the river we held a new courfe over a fine level, then down a rich hollow to a run, where we faw a fummer duck; and fo down the run, a little beyond this turns a path to Wiomick, a town on the eaft branch, hence N. N. E. then N. after W. to a rich bottom near the river, where Shickcalamy formerly dwelt, at the upper end of which refftlefs torrents had carried abundance of fand into the woods. With this bottom we left the river for the prefent, and kept a variable courfe through the gap of the mountain N. and N. W. over middling champion land, producing fome pitch pine, and large white and black oak, fome fwamps and brooks, by one of which we lodged in a fertile valley, that we reached before night.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 11. About break of day it began to rain, and the Indians made us a covering of bark got after this manner: They cut the tree round through the bark near the root, and make the like incifion above 7 feet above it, there horizontal ones are joined by a perpendicular cut, on each fide of which they after loofen the bark from the wood, and hewing a pole at the fmall end, gradually tapering like a wedge about 2 feet, they force it in till they have compleated the feparation all round, and the bark parts whole from the tree, one of which, a foot diameter, yields a piece 7 feet long and above 3 wide: And having now prepared four forked fticks, they are fet into the ground the longer in front; on thefe they lay the crofs-poles, and on them the bark. This makes a good tight fhelter in warm weather. The rain was quickly over, but as it continued cloudy, we did not care to leave our fhed. Here our Indians foot a young deer, that afforded us a good feaft.</p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 12. We fet forward and travelled up the Run, bearing N. W. along a narrow valley, moderately rich, the hills hung with lofty timber, the ftones generally flat, then up a fleep hill, where I found foffil fteel in many ftones, the foil middling oak land; and here had a view of a Bluf point N. by the river fide; then defcending down a fteep hill N. E. we came to a rich bottom by the river; hence N. after N. W. to a creek, and fb through a grove of <Modal modal={words.whiteWalnut} />  and <Modal modal={words.locust} />, and exceeding rich land, half a mile broad, and now fome higher level land, affording oak, hickery, walnut, <Modal modal={words.locust} />, and pitch pine, our courfe generally N. N. W. till riding over a hazel plane we met eight Shawanefe Indians on horfeback coming from Allegheny, and going to Wiomick upon an important account, as they faid. We turned back with them to the adjacent wood, and fate down together under a fhady oak the fquaw which they brought to wait upon them kindled a fire to light their pipes; our Interpreter and Shickealamy fet down with them to fmoke, the cuftomary civility when two parties meet; Conrad Weifar underftanding they were fome chiefs of the Shawanefe, acquainted them with our bufinefs at Onondago, a compliment they were fo well pleafed with, that they gave us th Tobay, a particular Indian expreffion of approbation, and which is very difficult for a white man to imitate well; after half an hour’s grave difcourfe feveral of them went to catch the horfes, and one of the principal men made a handfome fpeech, with a pleafant well composed countenance, to our interpreter, to the following effect:  <br />'That they were fensible with what <br />'an unwearied diligence he had hitherto been <br />'inftrumental in preferving peace and good <br />'harmony between the Indians and White <br />'People, and that as they could not but now <br />'commend the prudence and zeal with which <br />'he had effe&ed this laudable purpole, lo <br />'they earneftly entreated and fincerely hoped <br />'he would Hi 11 perlevere in the fame endca- <br />'vours and with the fame fuecels, and that his <br />'good offices may never be wanting on any <br />'future occafion. <br />The Sbazvanefe , or Shaounons , as they are called by the French, are the fame people, the nations :and at A fee lork arecalled Stiauas , they dwell upon the Hoklo and to the  fouthward of it, between whom and that of the Cherokees is a river lbmetimes called by that name. It was againft this people the fix nations firft turned theif Arms with fuccels, after they had fled before warlike Adaron- dacks , and having thus learri’d to conquer, ventured to attack the'r hitherto victorious ene- mies, who could not have lupportcd this war without the unexpected alfiftance they received from the French. <br /> <br /> After taking our leaves, we continued our journey to a large creek 4 rod wide which wafhes on each fhore a charming country of rare foil as far as the river. On the other fide of this creek we rode through a deferted Town in the neck between them a few miles more brought us to our dining place, and in the afternoon we turned our backs on this branch, and rode N. W. down a valley 20 rods wide, wooded with pitch pine on the right hand and white on the left, the Run be- tween: then N. W. by W. by the fide of a hill and bottom of white pine, down which we rode 1 hours, upon better land, the N. W. middling land, now up a hill N. W. to a point, a prolpeCt of an opening bearing N. then down the hill to run, and over a rich neck lying be- tween it and Tiadanghton bearing N. W. where we lodged within about 50 yards of a hunting cabin, where there were 2 Men, a Squaw and a  child, the men came to our fire and made us prefent of l'ome venifon, and invited Mr IVeifar, Shtckalamy and his fon, to a feaft at their cabin. It is incumbent on thofe who partake of a feaft of this fort, to eat all that comes to their fhare or burn it: now Weifar being a traveller was intitled to a double fhare, but he being not very well, was forced to take the benefit of a liberty indulged him, of eating by proxy, and called me, but both being unable to cope with it, Lewis came in to our a Hilda nee, not- withftanding which we were hard let to get down the neck and throat, for thele were allotted us; and now we had experienced the utmoft bounds of their indulgence, for Lewis ignorant of the ceremony of throwing the bone to the dog, tho’ hungry Dogs are gene- rally nimble, the Indian more nimble, laid hold of it firft, and committed it to the fire, religioufly covering it over with hot afhes. This leems to be a kind of offering, perhaps firft fruits to the Almighty power to crave future fuccels in the approaching hunting lea- fon, and was celebrated with as much decency and more filence, than many fuperftitious ce- remonies: the bigotry of the popifh miftiona- ries tempt them to compafs fea and land to teach their weak Prolelites what they call the chriftian religion. To this I may add another ceremony at bear hunting, as related by a celebrated author, this dtverfion being in the winter when this animal is very fat, the greale that fwims on the broth becomes a perfect oil, which the Indians frequently drink untill they burft --- as soon as the bear is killed, the hunter places the Imall end of his pipe in its mouth, and by blowing in the bowls, fills the mouth and throat full of fimoak, then he conjures the departed Spirit not to refent the injury done his body, nor to thwart his future Iport in hunting, but as he receives no anfvver to this, in order to know if his prayers have prevailed, he cuts the ligament under the bear’s tongue, if thele ligaments contract and lhrivel up, being call into the fire, which is done with great folemnity and abundance of invocations: then it is efleemed a certain mark (as it rarely fails) that the manes are appealed. It was now time to return to our fire where we laid us down to reft. </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> The 13, in the morning, the Indians repaid our vifit, and entertained us with a familiar converfation for half an hour at the fire. We then let out up the creek, where I oblerved  three noble white pine trees, with many large  green cones hanging on the top and fide branches  over the creek, which was three rods broad and  pretty deep, had thefe been ripe I know not  how we Ihould have got at them, as they  were at the extremity of large branches, that  hung over the Water, on which part of the  branch they generally grow. Soon after we  came to a Ipacious level of m Idling land,  oak, and pine, next to a large rich bottom,  and at the upper end o an extenfive grove of  white pine, after this a graffy plain of ao acres,  then round the end of a hill, and along a valley, and run N. by W. high timber and good  land on the hill fide N. then W. and lafbly , at  half an hour after 8 N. here our Indians fhot a  young deer. The land and timber good, brown  loil, and the Hones flat and gritty. From  hence going over a hill we law a gap N. N.W.  and delcending down a fieep part of the hill  to the head of a Honey brook and hollow,  we made our way through it, it was full of  fpruce and white pine; at the bottom we  killed a rattle fnake, then crolfed the brook  and traverled a rich bottom N. N. E. the  upper end pine, fpruce, oak, laurel, poplar  and chefnut, fome limes, Honey and brown  foil, Icveral times crolfed the creek and over  rich bottoms and Honey hill fides with laurel,  pine, lpruce and fivamps, till towards night.  On the north fide of a deep Honey yet rich  foil, I found roots of Ginfeng; at night we  lodged by a creek; and the two Indians that  feaficd with us, who accompanied us to the Cayuga branch. </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> The 14th, Having lorded the creek we  kept generally a N. N.'E. courfe, moHly along  rich bottoms interlperled with large ” fpruce  and white pine, oak, beach and plane tree,  ginleng,  ginfong, and many more. We frequently pafie  the creek (which was very ftrong) for r!i e  mountains often clos’d on one fide: it was big  enough to turn two mills. At p o’clock the  Indians fi fired for trout, but caught none, being provided with no other means of taking  them but by poles fliarpened at the end to  fixike them, and the water deep: at the foot  of a hill we crofted the creek once more, and  rode along a fine bottom, full of great wild  nettles. The timber was fugar birch, fugar  maples, oak and poplar, our courle N. W.  continued till after 1 2 ’clock, then followed  the eaft branch N. N. E. about a mile, all a  rich bottom where we found a Licking Pond,  where we dined, the backs parts of our country are full of thefo liching ponds, fome are  of black fulphureous mud, fome of pale clay,  the deer and elks are fond of licking this clay,  fo that the pond becomes enlarged to’a rood or  hall an acre, the foil, I fuppofe contains fome  laline particles agreeable to the deer, who  come many miles to one of thefe places, there  had been a great elk there that morning, but  the Indians told us that many years ago fome  Indians quarrelled there, in the fquablc one  loft his life, and that this made the deer keep  from thence for many years.  <br /> <br />Now traveling up the run eaft, we left it on  the right hand, to go up a hill covered with  Iprucc, oak fpruee, lawrel, opulus, yew, with  2 ginieng,  ginfeng and atalialhum in abundance, then  kept generally an eaft cotirfe, having feveral  hollows and fteep alcents and over many  boggy rotten places, lome laurel and very  high timber, then down the fide of a hill to  an old beaver dam, over which we palled,  and then over a large level of very good  ground, tall timber and abundance of leatherbark or thy me lea , which is plentiful in all this  part of the country. Our lodging was in this  ipacious flat. </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> The 15th, We fet out aN. E. courle, and  pa fled by very thick and tall timber of beach,  chelhut, linden alii, great magnolia, fugarbirch, fugar-maple, poplar, fpruce and fome  white pine, with ginfeng and maidenhair;  the foil black on the furface, and brown underneath, the Hones a brown grit, the way very  uneven over fallen trees, abundance of hollows,  and heaps of earth, turned up by the roots  of proftrate timber: hence it is that the furface is principally conrpofed of rotten trees,  roots, and mols, perpetually fhaded, and for  the raoft part wet, what falls is conftantly  rotting and rendring the earth loole and Ipungy ,  this tempts abundance of yellow walps to  breed in it, which were very troublelome  to us throughout our journey, on the branches  of Sufqnehanab our courle this day was generally eaft, and we got through this dilmal  wildcrnefs about two hours before funfet, and  came to oak and hickery land, then down keep hill producing white pine to a creek called  Comma a branch of Tomntohow, where we  lodged in a bottom producing ginieng, fareaparilla mediola, maidenhair, darallia, panax,  rnitela, chrihophoriana, with white, red and  blue berries , we had a fine warm night, and  one of the Indians that had fio generoufly  feafled ns, fung in a folemn harmonious manner, for feven or eight minutes, very different  from the common Indian tune, from whence  I conjectured it to be a hymn to the great  fpirit as they exprefs it. In the morning I  asked the Interpreter what the Indian meant  by it, but he did not hear him, and indeed I  believe none of the company heard him but  myfelf, who wake with a little noife, rarely  Deeping found abroad. </p>,     \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> The 16th, We began our journey up a little  hill, fteep and fomewhat honey, and then  through oak, chefnut, huckleberries, and  honeyfuckl'es, the land poor, fometimes white  pine, fpruce and lawrel; thus far N. but at  half an our after feven N. E. through a great  white pine, fpruce fwamp full of roots, and  abundance of old trees lying on the ground,  or leaning againft live ones, they flood fo  f thick that we concluded it almoft impoffible  to fhoot a man at ioo yards diftant, let him  hand never fo fair. The hraight bodies of  thefe trees hood fo thick, a bullet muh hit  one before it could fly ioo yards, in the moll open part. At half an hour after nine, we rode  down a fmall hill, and crofted a fmall run  then climb’d a fteep hill of oak land, and by  ten to a large creek called Uskoho , then round  the point of a hill, midling land, and up  the fide thereof which was good, and  down the other fide very fteep to a Run,  with good corn land to the top of a hill in  fight of the eaft branch of Sufquehanah , fo far  we had pale clay land from the vvildernels,  though blackifh on the furface, for 2, 3 or 4  inches, then down half a mile on a moderate  defeent, good oak and hickery land to a large  rich grafty and weedy bottom, 40 rood wide,  producing elm:, birch, linden, lotus, whitewalnut, and very large white pine, where the  land is a little higher than common; at the  upper end of this bottom we dined at half an  hour after 12, we let out again at 3, courfeN.  along a fteep hill fide, full of excellent flat  whet-ftones of all fixes, from half a foot, to 4 feet long, and from 2 inches to a foot wide,  and from half an inch to a foot thick; I brought  one home which I have ufed to whet my ax,  feythe, chizzels and knife, and is yet very little  the vvorfe for wear, it is as fine as the Engljb  rag, but of a blackifh colour: this lafted two  miles clofe to the river which is here 100 yards  wide, and deep enough for flat-bottomed boats,  then we came to a very rich low land, moft of the way N. N. E. to the Cayuga branch, near  100 yards wide which wc crofted, then rode  near a mile to the town-houfe, bearing N. this  town is called Tohicon , and lies in a rich neefc  between the branch and main river: the Indians  welcomed us by beating their drum, as loon as  they faw us over the branch, and continued  beating after the Englifb manner as we rode to  the houfe, and while we unfaddled our Horfos,  laid in our luggage and entered our felves: the  Houle is about 30 foot long, and the fined  or any I faw among them. The Indians cut  long grals and laid it on the floor for us to fit  or lie on; leveral of them came and lat down  and linoaked their pipes, one of which was  fix foot long, the head of done, the flem a  reed , after this they brought victuals in the  ufual manner: here I oblerved for the firfi  time in this journey, that the worms which  had done much mifohiefin leveral parts of our  Province, by deflroying the grals and even  corn for two fummers, had done the lame thing  here, and had eat off the blade of their maize  and long white grals, fo that the Aems of both  flood naked 4 foot high; I faw dome of the  naked dark coloured grubs half an inch long,  tho’ moft of them were gone, yet I could  perceive they were the fame that had vifited  us two months before; they clear all the grals  in their way, in any meadow they get into,  and feem to be periodical as the locufls and  caterpillar, the latter of which I am afraid  will do us a great deal of milchief next dimmer. Here one of our hofts at the hunting  cabin left us to go up this branch to his own  country, that of the Cayagas, this night it rained  a little, and the morning was very foggy.  </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 17<sup>th</sup>.  Day, we croffed the neck to the eaft  branch of Sufquehanah, up which we travelled  along a rich bottom of high grals and woods of  a fine creek, then over oak and pitch pine land  to a fwampy run and fine meadow ground,  then eaft through white and pitch pine, oak,  hickery and hazel bottom, and fo N. E. to  the river, where grew, a white pine dole to the  water, with four green cones on. ftill we kept  N. E. at io bore S. Here the river turned  thus, occafloncd by fome high barren mountains on the other fide, whole lides came dole  to it, and turned the ftrearn in this crooked  manner. We travelled through a fine vale of  pine land. Here was a place where the Indians had been a pawawing. They cut a parcel  of poles, which they flick in the ground in  a circle, about the bignels of hop poles, the cicrie  about five foot diameter, and then bring them  together at the top, and tie them in form of  an oven, where the conjurer placeth himfelfthen his adiftants cover the cage over clofo  with blankets and to make it ftill more  fuffbeating, hot ftones are rolled in: after  all this the prieft mull cry aloud, and agitate  his Vide Capt. Beverley's hii! of Virginia, a curious and  ufeiul work, and the Daren Labontans entertaining voyages  in theft parts,  his body after the moft violent manner, till  nature has almoft loft all her faculties before  the ftubborn fpirit will become vifible to him,  which they fay is generally in the fliape of  fome bird. There is ufually a ftake drove into  the ground about four foot high and painted.  I fuppofe this they defign for the winged any  Being to perch upon, while he reveals to the  invocant what he has taken fo much pains to  know. However, I find different nations  have different ways of obtaining the pretended  information. Some have a bowl of water,  into which they often look, when their  ftrength is almoft exhaufted, and their fenles  failing, to lee whether the fpirit is ready to  anfwer their demands. I have feen many of  thefe places in my travels. They differ from  their fweating coops, in that they are often  far from water, and have a ftake by the cage,  yet both have a heap of red hot ftones put in.  at ii we d veiled our dinner, and found an  Indian by the river fide, refting himfelf; all  his provifion was a dried eel: this he made us  a prcfent of, and we gave him a lhare of our  dinner. Their way of roafting eels is thus;  they cut a ftick about three foot long, and as  thick as one’s thumb, they fplit 'it about a  foot down, and when the eel is gutted, they  coil it between the two fides of the ftick,  and bind the top clofe, which keeps the eel  flat, and then ftick one end in the ground before a good fire.  F  At half an hour after one we let out, middling oak land but ftony, yet no great rocks;  at a N. E. then N. good land, a rich bottom  and flat Hones on rifing ground; we croffed  the Owagan branch about thirty yards wide.  Then half a mile to the town fo called, where  we lodged, there is very good land in this  neck between the branch and main river. A  little before fun-fet I walked out of town to  regulate my journal; but the gnats were fo  troublefome I could not reft a minute. They  bit my hands fo cruelly I was forced to give  over my purpofe. Thefe are lb troublefome  from fun-rifing to fun-fetting that we could  not reft while we were eating our victuals  without making feveral fires of wet leaves  round us to keep them off. </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 18. This morning we lent an Indian with  a firing of Wampum to Onondaga, to acquaint  them with our coming, and the bufinels we  came about, that they might lend meflengers  to the ieveral nations to haften their deputies  to meet them as loon as polfible, for this  town ferves the five nations as Baden does the  thirteen cantons of Switzerland, with this  difference, that Onondago is at the lame time the  capital of a canton.  We fet out at half an hour after p, and  travelled till 6; this day our general courle  was N. and N. W. having fine level rich land  moll of the way, and rail timber oak, birch,  beech, afti, fpruce, linden, elm and herb  hierophilon, hepatica and maidenhair in abundance. We lodged by Front Creek in a fpatious vale, and it looking like rain, we made  us a cabbin of lpruce bark, but no rain  came. </p>,\n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 19. We rode over good level land: after  we came to very fwampy bottoms, thickets  and hills of fpruce, and white pine; here  were three ridges of fteep hills that run nearly  E. and W „ and with difficulty we rode over  their fteep cliffs, which projected clofe to the  creek. We were feveral times obliged to  ford it backwards and forwards. Several runs  come into the creek on both ftdes from between the mountains, Now we came to moft  excellent level ground, than which nothing  can be more fruitful, full of tall timber, fugar,  maple, birch, linden, afti, and beech, and  fhrubs, as opulus, green maple, hornbeam,  hama m elis, folanum, goofterries and red cur-  tans triphilum in abundance. Here we dined  by a pleafant creek and choice land. Alter  dinner we foon began to mount up a pretty  fteep hill, covered with oak, birch, afti, and  higher up abundance of chefnut and lome  hickery. This is middling land, the produce  the fame for three miles as our land bears  with us. It lies very high, and when cleared  will have an extenftve profpect of fertile  vales on all ftdes. We then rede down a long rich hill of moderate delcent, where grew abundance of goofeberries , all the trees were  crouded with wild pigeons, which, I fuppofe,  breed in thefe lofty fhady trees. I found many fbflils on this hill.  Another fertile valley welcomed us at the  bottom, over which travelling a mile we  lodged at a Run, which our Indians told us  emptied into the lake Ontario; if fo, it muft  run into the Cayuga river, and fo to Ofwego.      </p>,       \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 20<sup>th</sup>. We continued our journey in this pleasant vale until we afcended a hill, beyond  which a flant brought us to two ponds that  run into a branch of Sufquehanah; croffing  this we joined a part from the Carugas country; then over a rich level to another branch  big enough to turn a mill where we crolfed it.  It was now three-quarters after 10, then  good land to half an hour after x 2 yet no  hickcry nor oak, but elm, fugar, maple,  beech, birch, white walnuts, hop, hornbeam,  and abundance of ginfeng. After dinner we  palled a branch of the great Sufquehanah ,  down which lake canoes may go quite to where  the river is navigable for boats. On the  banks I found the gale like the European.  This is the neared branch of Sufquehanah  river to that of Onondago. Leaving this on  our right, on our left we perceived a hill  where the Indians fay Indian corn, tobacco  and fquafhes were found on the following occasion, call on: An Indian (wbofe wife bad eloped)  came hither to hunt, and with his skins to  purchale another here, he efpied, a young  fquaw alone at the hill; going to her, and  enquiring where Ihe came from, he received  for anfwer, that lhe came from heaven to  provide fuftenance for the poor Indians , and  if he came to that place twelve months  after he fhould find food there. He cameaccordingly and found corn, fquafhes and to*  bacco, which were propagated from thence  and fpread through the country, and this filly  ftory is rcligioufly held for truth among them.  Our way hence, lay over fine rich level land  as before, but when we left it, we enter’d a  miferable thicket of Ipruce, opulus, and dwarf  yew, then over a branch of Sufquehanah , big  enough to turn a mill, came to ground as  good as that on the other fide the thicket;  well cloathed with tall timber of lugar birch,  fugar maple, and elm. In the afternoon it  thunder’d hard pretty near us, but rained little:  We obferved the tops of the trees to be lo dole  to one another for many miles together, that  there is no feeing which way the clouds drive,  nor which way the wind lets: and it leems  almoft as if the fun had never Ihone on the  ground, fince the creation. About fun let  it cleared up, and we encamped on the laft  branch of Sufquehanah, the night following it  thundred and rained very fall, and took us  at a difad vantage, for we had made no fhelter  to keep off the rain, neither could we fee it  till juft over our heads, and it began to fall.  One of our Indians cut 4 fticks 5 feet long,  and ftuck both ends into the ground, at 2 foot  diftance, one from another; over thefo he fpread  his match coat and crept through them, and  then fell to hinging: in the medn time we were  fetting poles flantwifo in the ground, tying  others crols them, over which we . fpread our  blanket and crept dole under it with a fire  before us and fell faft afleep.  I waked a little after midnight, and found  our fire almoft out, fo I got the hatchet and  felled a few faplings which I laid on, and made  a roufing fire, tho’ it rained ftoutly, and laying  down once more, I flept found all night.      </p>,      \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 21<sup>ft</sup>. In the morning when we had dry’d our  blankets, we kept along the fide of a hill,  gradually afcending, the foil good, timber  tall, and abundance of ginfeng; here the muiquetoes were veryltroublefome, it being foggy,  thence proceeding down a long gradual defcent  on good rich foil with tall timber, fugar, maple, chefnut, cherry, lindenand elm, we traveled a large valley and rivulet, then rode up  a little fteep hill where we flopped at half an  hour after eleven, this hill was a little fandy,  with forae large pines growing upon it; here  we walked and looked about us, having not  nad luch an opportunity for two davs, during  which  time we had a fine profpeCt over the  vale of the great mountain we had juft crofted,  and which differed fo remarkably from all I  had ever been upon before, in its eafy and fruitful afcent and defcent, in its great width,  every where crowned with noble and lofty  woods, but above all, in its being intirely free  from naked rocks and fteep precipices.  From thefe remarks, one might be naturally  led to imagine, that the Waters at the flood  gradually ebbed and retired on each fide, towards the river St. Lawrence and Sufqnehanah ,  the very next ridges on either fide being narrower, fteeper, and fome rocks wafhed bare,  and fo all the adjacent ridges the farther they  are from this, appear to be more wafhed, more  compofed of great banks of craggy rocks and  tremendous precipices, the foil more carried off,  mighty rocks tumbled down, and thole leftappearing as if piled up in a pyramid and hereby  preferved from a fhare in the awful ruin below  among their fellows; the foil being fo perfectly wafhed from their root, as evidently no  longer to fupport them- After having enjoyed  this enchanting profpect and entertaining hypothefis, we delcended eafily for foveral miles,  over good land producing lugar-maples, many  of which the Indians had tapped to make  fugar of the fap, alfo oaks, hickery, white  walnuts, plums and fome apple trees, full of  fruit; the Indians had fet long bufhes all round  the trees at a little diftance, I fuppofe to keep  the final! children from ftealing the fruit before  they were rjpe’ here we halted and tinned our  horfes to grafs, while the inhabitants cleared a  cabin for our reception; they brought us  victuals, and we difpatched a meffenger immediately to Qmndago to let them know  how near we were, it being within 4 miles.  All the Indians , men, women and children  came to gaze at us and our horfes, the little  boys and. girls climbed on the roofs of their  cabins, about ten in number to enjoy a fuller  view, we let out about ten, and travelled over  good land all the way, moftly an ealydefcent,  ibrue lime-ftone, then down the eaft hill, over  ridges of lime-ftone rock, but generally a moderate defeent into the fine vale where this  capital (if I may lo call it) is fituated.  We alighted at the council houle, where  the chiefs were already aflembled to receive us,, which they did with a grave chearful complaifance, according to their cuftom;  they fhew’d us where to lay our baggage, and  repofe ourielves during our ftay with them;  which was in the two end apartments of this  large houle. The Indians that came with us,  were placed over againft us: this cabin is about  80 feet long, and 17 broad, the common  paflage 6 feet wide, and the apartments on  each fide 5 feet, railed a foot above the palfage  by a long fapling hewed fquare, and fitted   tvith joifts that go from it. to the back of the  houie; on thefe joifts they lay large pieces of  hark, and on extraordinary occafions lprcad  marts made of rallies, this favour we had; on  thefe floors they let or lye down every one as  he will, the apartments are divided from each  other by boards or bark, 6 or 7 loot long,  from -the lower floor to the upper, on which  they put their lumber, when they have eaten  their homony, as they let in each apartment  before the fire, they can put the bowel over  head, having not above 5 foot to reach; they  let on the floor fometimes at each end, but  modify at one: they have a fhed to put their  wood into in the winter, or in the fummer,  to flat to converfe or play, that has a door  to the fouth; all the fides and roof of the cabin  is made of bark, bound fall to poles let in the  ground, and bent round on the top, or fet  afiatt, for the roof as we let our rafters; over  each fire place they leave a hole to let out the  imoak, which in rainy weather, they cover  with a piece of bark, and this they can eafily  reach with a pole to pufh it on one fide or  quite over the hole, after this model are molt  of their cabins built, figure annexed.  The fine vale of Gnoudaga runs north and  fouth, a little inclining to the weft, and is  near a mile wide, where the town is fituated  and excellent foil, the river that divides this  charming vale, is 2, 3 or 4 foot deep, very full of trees fallen acrols, or drove on heaps  by the torrents. The town in its prelent Hate  is about 2 or 3 miles long, yet the fcattered  cabins on both Tides the water, are not above  40 in number, many of them hold 1 families,  but all Hand fingle, and rarely above 4 or near one another; lb that the whole town is a  ftrange mixture of cabins, interfperfed vvithgreat  patches of high grals, bulhes and fhrubs, lome  of peale, corn and fquafhes, lime-ftone bottom  compoled of foffils and lea fhells.  It leems however, to have been more confiderable when it became a conqueft to the  arms of Lewis 14th, at which time it muft  have been more com pad, for hiftory relates  it to have been llockadoed. The Count k  Frontenac governor of Canada , at the head  of the moft numerous army the French ever  drew together in N. America , had the fatisfaction in 1696 of triumphing over the alhesof  Onondago , whole inhabitants terrified with  what they had heard of bombs, and generally  unwilling to hazard a fet battle, had already  abandoned their houfes after letting them afire,  whatever glory the grand monarque might  reap from this exploit, it is certain he gained no other advantage, as a longer Hay  muft have inevitably ftarved the army, fo its  precipitate retreat helped our Indians to an  opportunity of taking their revenge by cutting  of every firagling canoe, in their return by  water to Monreal,  At night, loon after we were laid down to  fleep, and our fire almoft burnt out, we were  ep pertained by a comical fellow, difguifed in  as odd a drels as Indian folly could invent;  he had on a clumfy vizard of wood colour’d  black, with a nole 4 or ,5 inches long, a grining  mouth fet awry, furnifhed with long teeth,  round the eyes circles of bright brals, furrounded by a larger circle ol white paint,  from his forehead hung long trefles of buffaloes  haif, and from the catch part of his head ropes  made of tire plated husks of Indian corn; I  pannot recoiled the whole of his drefs, but  that it was equally uncouth: he carried in one  hand a large ftaff, in the other a calabafh with  i'mall Hones in it, for a rattle, and this he  rubbed up and down his Haff- he would  fometimes hold up his head and make a hideous noife like the braying of an afs; he came  in at the further end, and made this noife at  firft, whether it W S3 becaufe he would not.  l'urprife us too fuddenly I can’t fay: I ask d  Conrad Weifer , who as well as myfelf lay  next the alley, what noife that was? and Shickalamy the Indian chief, our companion, who  I fuppofed, thought me fomewhat feared,  called out, lye Hill John , I never heard him  fpcak fo much plain Englijh before. Thejackpudding prefently came up to us, and an Indian: a boy came with him and kindled our fire, that  „ might lee his glittering eyes and antick  poftures as he hobbled round the fire, fometimes  he would turn the Buffaloes hair on one fide  that we might take the better view of his ill favoured phyZ, when he had tired himfelf,  which was fometimb after he had well tired us,  the boy that attended him ftrucfc 2 or 3 fmart  blows on the floor, at which the hobgoblin  feemed furprifed and on repeating them he  jumped fairly out of doors and difappeared.  I luppofe this was to divert us and get fome  tobacco for himfelf, for as he danced about  he would hold out his hand to any lie came  by to receive this gratification which as often  as any one gave him he would return an awkard compliment. By this I found it no new  diverfion to any but my felf. In my whim  I faw a vizard of this kind hang by the fide  of one of their cabins to another town. After this farce we endeavoured to compote ourfelvcs to Beep but towards morning was again  difturbed by a drunken Squaw coming into  the cabin frequently complimenting us. and  finging. </p>,          \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 22<sup>d</sup>. was a fhowery day, and we ftirred little out. </p>,      \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 23<sup>d</sup>. we hired a guide to go with us to the  fait Ipring, 4 or 5 miles off, down the river,  on the weft fide of it’s mouth 3 being molt of  the way good land, and near the mouth very  rich: from whence it runs wefhvard near a  quarter ol a mile, a kind of a landy beach adjoining to the bank of the river, containing 3  or 4 acres. Here the Indians dig holes, about  2 foot deep, which foon filling with brine, they  dip their kettles, and boil the contents, until  the fait remains at bottom; there was a family refiding at this time. The boys in the  lake fifhing, the Squaw fetching water, gathering wood, and making a fire under the kettle,  while the husband was basking himlelf on the  land, under the bufhes. We filled our gallon  keg full of water and brought it to Town,  where we boiled it to about a pound of fait.  Our guides took their arrows, made of reed and  down to fhoot fmall birds. About half way  there is an excellent fpring of water, and by it  a grove of Curboroita’. joining to a green fwamp,  producing very high grafs. About a mile up  the river from the lake, it runs by a ftecp bank  at the end of a high hill. The bank was landy,  and out of it run’d a brackifh water, which  inclines me to think that there is a body of  fofSl fait here abouts, by which the plain is  fmnifhed with its intenle fait brine, and that  it is the vapour thereof that congealj to the  trafh and bufhes that lye on the bank, and  glitters like flakes of Ice, or Snow, in a Sunfininy day. This day a deputies arrived from  the Cqyugas Country.       </p>,      \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 24<sup>th</sup>. Lewis and I hired a guide to go with us. 4th. Lewis and I hired a guide to go with  us to Ofwego for 1 6s. our intention was more  to get provifions for our journey home, than  to gratify our curiolity. In the mean time,  Cowad flayed at Onondaga, to treat with the  Indian chiefs about the skirmifh in Virginia;  with a view to incline them fingly in favour of  our application, before they affembled in council: and here I cannot help obferving, it was  Scarcely ever known, that an Indian Chief or  Conncellor , once gained fo far as to promife  him intereft, did break his promife, whatever  prefen ts have been offered him from another  quarter.  We travelled on foot to the Onondaga lake,  whence we had fetched the fait water the day  before, there we procured a hark canoe at half  an hour after eleven, then paddled down  the lake, and reached the lower end in two  hours courle, N. W. This lake the French  call Ganentahd; hence we went down the  river a mile N. big enough to carry a large  boat, if the trees fallen into it where but carried away, this brought us to the river from  the Cayuga country, near ioo yards wide, very  flill, and fo deep we could fee no bottom, the  land on both fides very rich and low to within a mile of the Oneido. river , where the river  began to run fvvift, fand the bottom became  vifible, tho’ at a good depth. At three o’clock  we came to the laft mention’d river, down  which the Abb any trader come to Ofcuego, half  a mile farther we came to a rippling, which  carried us with prodigious fwiftnefs down the  ftream, foon after we encountered a iecond,  and a mile farther a third, very rough. In  about an hour by the fun, after many other  ripplings, we found our felves at the great fall,  the whole breadth of the river which is above  ioo yards wide and is eight or ten feet perpendicular: here we hawled our canoe afhore,  took out all our baggage, and carried it on our  back a mile to a little town, of about four or  five cabins: they chiefly fubfift by catching  fifh and alfifling the lie any people to hawl  their Bateans , and carry their goods round the  falls: which may be about tenor twelve poles,  then they launch again into the river, and  down the foaming flream that furioufly on all  fides dalhes one half againfi the rocks, near a  mile before they come to ftifl water, and indeed, it runs pretty fvvift all the way to Ojzveso. Thefe Indians were very kind to us,  and gave us boiled corn and water melons,  while they and our guide who was a relation  fat over againfi us in the fame cabin, chewing  raw Indian corn flalks, fpitting out the lubflance alter they fucked out the juice. But  we could not yet underftand whether we were  to go to the fort by land, or by wafer. In  the morning they had catched fonie flout eels,  and a great fifh two feet long, it was round  and thick, they ftrike them with long fiender fnafts 1 8 or a o feet long, pointed at the end  with iron fee the Ihape. The i fplints of wood  fpreading each fide, directs the point into the  filh, which at a great depth it would be otherwife difficult to hit. I law upon one of their  canoes in the morning a large piece of bark  Ipread a-crofs. On this lay gravel and fand,  and on thefe coals and allies, which I luppoled  had been a fire, and the gravel placed there  to lave the bark. And I took it to be a defign both to allure and lee to ftrike the fiffi. </p>,      \n    \n        <p className=\"pageText center\"> 25th. Our guide, and leveral other Indians ,  lead us to the canoes belonging to the town,  into one of which we got full of hopes of going by water, but were much chagrin’d to find  ourfelves only paddled crols the water, where  we unwillingly took out our cloaths, victuals  and blankets, and carried them on our backs  following our guides, who were now increaled  to three. We had 1 2 miles down the river by  land, ' molt of the way middling land, fome  white pine and fpruce groves to pals through,  but moft of the way in fight of the river,  which is very rapid moft of the way to the  lake. On the point formed by the entrance  of the river. Hands the fort or trading caftlc,  it is a ftrong ftone houfe, incompaffed with a  ftone wall near 20 feet high, and 1 20 paces  round, built of large lquared ftones; very curious for their loftneft, I cut my name in it  with my knife. The town confifts of about  70 loghoufes, of which one half are in a row  near the river, the other halfoppoflte to them,  on the other fide of a fair were two ftreets divided by a row of pofts in the midit. Where  each Indian has his houfe to lay his goods, and  where any of the traders may traffick with him.  This is furely an excellent regulation for preventing the traders from impofing on the Indians, a pradife they have been formerly too  much guilty of, and which has frequently involved the Englijh colonies in difficulties, and  conftantlf tended to depreciate us in the efteeni  of the natives } W ho can fcarcely be blamed  for judging ofa nation, by the behaviour of thole  with whom they have the moft intercourfe.  a judgment I am lorry to confels that has (till  lately) tended much to the making them in  favour rather of the French, than Englifh. I  ipeak of private perfons, not of the relpedive  government. The chief officer in command  at the caftle, keeps a good look out to Ice  when the Indians come down the lake with  their poultry and furrs, and lends a canoe to  meet them, which conduds them to the callle,  to prevent any perlon inticing them to put alhore privately, treating them with lpirituous  liquors, and then taking that opportunity of  cheating them. This officer fcems very carefull that all quarreling, and even the leal, nufunderftanding, when any happens, be quickly  made up in an amicable manner, fince a fpeedy accomodation can only prevent our country  men from incuring the imputation of injuftice,  and the delay of it would produce the difagreeable confequences of an Indians endeavouring  to right himfelf by force.  Ofwego, is an infant fettlement made by the  province of New-lork , with the noble view  of gaining to the crown of Great Britain the  command of the 5 lakes, and the dependence  of the Indians in their neighbourhood, and to  its fubjects the benefit of the trade upon them,  and of the rivers that empty themfelves into  them. At prefent the whole navigation is carried  on by the Indians themfelves in bark canoes,  and there are perhaps many reafons for defirihg  it fhould continue fo for fbme years at leaf!::  but a good englifhman cannot be without  hopes of feeing thefe great lakes become one  day accuftomed to Englijb navigation. It is  true, the lamous fall of Niagara , is an infurmountable bar to all paflage by water, from  the lake Ontario, into the lake Erie, in fuch  veffels a3 are proper for the fecure navigation  of either; but befides, that bark canoes are  carried on mens fhOulders with eafe, from one  to the other, as far as the paflage is impracticable: It will be much more ealy to carry the  goods in waggons, fiom the upper lake,  mto the Huron or guatoghie lake, the flrait  1S rendered unnavigable by the Saute St. Marie  but a veffel of confiderable burthen may fail from the hither end of the Erie lake, to the  bottom of the lake Michigan , and for ought  vve know, through all parts of the 3 middle  lakes. Tliefe lakes receive the waters of many  rivers, that in fome places approach lb near the  branches of the vaft river that a  fhort land carriage fupplies the communication.  And here to ufe the words of a moft judicious  writer, “ He that reflects on the natural Hate  “ of that continent muft open to himlelf a  a field for traffick in the fouthern parts of N.  “ America , and by the means of this river  u and the lakes, the imagination takes into  “ view fuch a feene of inland navigation; as  cannot be paralleled in any other part of  u the world. ”  The honour of firft dilcovering thele extenfive frelh water Teas, is certainly due to the  French , who are at this time in pofleffion of  fettlements at Fort Fonchartrian , on the ftrait  between Lake Erie and the Lake Huron and  at Mijlltmahinac between the latter and the  upper lake, but as thefei can give them no title againft the original inhabitants or the five  nations. Conquerors of all the adjacent nations, lo it is difficult to conceive by what arguments thele fmall pofts, inhabited by no fubjecitsof France but l'oldiers, can be extended to  mark any pofiefiion beyond the reach of  their gun’s, or land actually cultivated, except by Inch as muft intitle the crown of Great Britain to all North America , both as trior  difcoverers and prior planters, without a fubfequent defertion. ..  The traders from New Tork come hither,  up the Mohawks river, which difcharges itfelf  into Uudfons river ;but generally go by land  from Albany , to Schenectady about 10 miles  from the Mohawks river, the carriage is but  3 miles into the river that falls into the 0neido lake, which difcharges itfelf by the Onei do  river, into the Onondaga river, and brings their  goods to Ojwego in the manner I have before  related.  W e came to the town about i a o’clock, the  commiffary invited us to the caftle where we  dined, together with the Door and Clerk.  After dinner we had the fatisfaflion of fwimmingin the la ke Ontario, which is fbme times  called by our Indians Cadarakin , this is alio  the name of a french fort upon it, almoft oppofite to Ofwego , N. it has 4 baftions built  of Hone, and is near half a mile in circumference;  it Hands where the waters of this lake are already formed into the river St. Lawrence, which  makes a good road for great barks under the  point of Cadarakin Bay. The famous and  unfortunate .Mr. De la Sale had two barks  which remains funk there to this day.  Thefe lakes are faid to have a kind cf flux  and reflux peculiar, fince it is affirmed to be fenfiblv ebb and flood ieveral times in a quarter  of an hour, tho’ it be perfectly fmooth and fcarce any wind.', But it is evident from the  face of the earth, that the water of the lake  Ontario is confiderably diminifhed and has loft  ground a great number of years, for the  fhores above a mile within land, are abundantly more low, as well as of a loofer texture then the foil beyond, whether this effedl  is in common to all the waters on the  earth, according to a conjefture of the  great Sir Jfaac Newton: Or whether it be  not at (leaft in parO owing to the removal  of fome great obftru&ion, which by caufing  a fall in the river St. Lawrence , might formerly pen the waters up to a greater height  than now; or only to the gradual wearing  away by the perpetual paflage of the water  over thole falls that ftill fubfift: or to a casual ruin of fome part of one of them, I  lhall leave to the determination of a more  «ble naturalift than myfelf.  The water was very clear and as cold as  our river in May, it is well tailed and fuppofed to he rao miles broad, and near aoo  long, ftreachipg N. N. W. but thismuft be an  error, the common maps giving it a bearing  to the Northward of the lake, but Mr. Beilin  thews us it lies E. and W. from the obfervations oOP. Charlevoix, on the exanefs of which  he thinks he cannot too much relie, and Bellm in his map of thefe lakes has given it this  bearing. We lodged in the caftle in the captains chamber.      </p>,      \n    \n        // <p className=\"pageText center\"> </p>,  \n    ]     \n export default Book\n","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Book from \"./Book/pages\"\nimport \"./Etext.css\";\nimport { Container, Header, Icon, Pagination } from 'semantic-ui-react'\n\nclass Etext extends Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = { activePage: 1 };\n\t}\n\n\thandlePaginationChange = (e, { activePage }) => { this.setState({ activePage }) }\n\n\trender() {\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div className=\"Etext\">\n\t\t\t\t{this.state.activePage > 1 ? <Header as=\"h2\" className=\"Headers center\"> Day {parseInt(this.state.activePage) - 1} - <a href=\"https://tourbuilder.withgoogle.com/tour/ahJzfmd3ZWItdG91cmJ1aWxkZXJyEQsSBFRvdXIYgIDgmOCh0QoM\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tour</a> <h2 className=\"center Etext-Title\">Observations made by John Bartram.</h2> </Header> : <React.Fragment />}\n\t\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"Contents\"> {Book[this.state.activePage]} </Container>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"centerDiv\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<Pagination defaultActivePage={this.state.activePage}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tellipsisItem={{ content: <Icon name='ellipsis horizontal' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirstItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle double left' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlastItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle double right' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle left' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnextItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle right' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotalPages={Book.length - 1}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonPageChange={this.handlePaginationChange}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclassName=\"paging\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t};\n}\n\nexport default Etext;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport \"./NavBar.css\";\n\nexport default class Navbar extends Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = { activeItem: 'Home', userLogin: \"Login\" };\n\t}\n\n\thandleItemClick = () => { return window.location.reload() }\n\n\trender() {\n\t\tconst { activeItem } = this.state\n\t\tconst navBtnColor = \"#bbb\"\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div className=\"NavBar\">\n\t\t\t\t<Menu secondary>\n\t\t\t\t\t<Menu.Item\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname='Etext'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactive={activeItem === 'Etext'}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonClick={this.handleItemClick}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinverted color='teal'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle={{color: navBtnColor}}\n\t\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t\t</Menu>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./NotFound.css\";\n\nfunction NotFound(props) { \n    return (\n        <div className = \"NotFound\">\n\n            <div className=\"NF-Title\">NotFound</div>\n        </div>\n    ) \n}\n\nexport default NotFound;\n  ","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport Home from \"./Pages/Home/Etext.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"./Components/NavBar/NavBar.js\"\nimport NotFound from \"./Components/NotFound/NotFound.js\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (   \n      <Router>\n        <React.Fragment>\n          <NavBar NavPage={this.AppPage} />\n          <Switch> \n            <Route exact path=\"/observations\"> <Home /> </Route>\n            <Route component={NotFound} />\n          </Switch>\n        </React.Fragment>\n      </Router>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
