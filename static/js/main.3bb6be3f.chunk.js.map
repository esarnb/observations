    <p> The tree ferns are the ferns that grow with a trunk elevating the leaves (fronds) above ground level.  </p>,\n            <p> Tree ferns are found growing in tropical and subtropical areas, including cool to temperate rainforests in Australia, New Zealand and neighbouring regions (e.g. Malaysia, Lord Howe Island, etc.). Like all ferns, tree ferns reproduce by means of spores formed on the undersides of the fronds.</p>,\n            // <p> The fronds of tree ferns are usually very large and multiple-pinnate. Their trunk is actually a vertical and modified rhizome, and woody tissue is absent. To add strength, there are deposits of lignin in the cell walls and the lower part of the stem is reinforced with thick, interlocking mats of tiny roots.[3] If the crown of Dicksonia antarctica (the most common species in gardens) is damaged, it will inevitably die because that is where all the new growth occurs. But other clump-forming tree fern species, such as D. squarrosa and D. youngiae, can regenerate from basal offsets or from \"pups\" emerging along the surviving trunk length. Tree ferns often fall over in the wild, yet manage to re-root from this new prostrate position and begin new vertical growth.</p>,\n            // <p> </p>,\n            // <p> </p>\n        ],\n        src: \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_fern\"\n    },\n    \n    oakTree: {\n        text: \"\",\n        \n        title: \"\",\n        img: \"\",\n        imgSize: \"\",\n        content: [<p> some text </p>],\n        src: \"\"\n    },\n    \n    chestnutTree: {\n        text: \"\",\n        \n        title: \"\",\n        img: \"\",\n        imgSize: \"\",\n        content: [<p> some text </p>],\n        src: \"\"\n    },\n\n    lamb: {\n        text: \"lamb\",\n        title: \"A young sheep\",\n        img: \"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/6c/d4/0b/6cd40b02efc9d1291e616da3868108be.jpg\",\n        imgSize: \"small\",\n        content: [\n            <p>Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock.

Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep is a lamb.</p>, \n            <p>Sheep are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia and one of the earliest animals to be domesticated for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleeces, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk. A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults). Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.</p>\n        ],\n        src: \"\"\n    },\n\n    puppy: {\n        text: \"puppy\",\n        title: \"A young dog\",\n        img: \"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vp7nW2SP6H8/maxresdefault.jpg\",\n        imgSize: \"small\",\n        content: [\n            <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog.

Having called on a man who was to go with us and carry part of our provifions to Shamokin, he could not get his horfe fhod that day, but we rode to William Parfons's plantation, who received and entertained us very kindly; his houfe is about fix miles from the Blue Mountains.</p>,\n    <p className=\"pageText center\">The 6<sup>th</sup>, we fet forward and afcended the firft Blue ridge, from the top of which we made an obfervation, Conrad Weifers Hill bearing fouth 20 degrees eaft, the northern profpect to two gaps, thro' which we were to pafs to the North Hill, N. 30 deg. W. about 10 miles diftant. The top and fouth fide of this ridge is midling land, half a quarter of a mile broad, and produced fome wild grafs, abundance of <Modal modal={words.fernTree} />, oak, and chefnut trees. Defcending the North fide we found it more poor, fteep and ftony, and come foon to the firft branch of Swataro which runs between the ridges, and is 3 miles from the next branch, all very poor land; but on this fecond branch, it is good low land, with large trees of 5 leaved white pine, poplar, and white oak, here we dined by a fpruce fwamp.<br /><br />After dinner we paffed the openings of two ridges, the laft of which was by the bank of the principal branch of Swataro, the foil poor and ftoney; then we afcended a great ridge about a mile fteep, and terribly ftoney moft of the way: near the top is a fine tho' fmall fpring of good water. At this place we were warned by a well known alarm to keep our diftance from an enranged rattle fnake that had put himfelf into a coiled pofture of defence, within a dozen yards of our path, but we punifhed his rage by ftriking him dead on the fpot: he had been highly irritated by an Indian dog that barked eagerly at him, but was cunning enough to keep out of his reach, or nimble enough to avoid the fnake when he fprung at him. We took notice that while provoked, he contracted the mufcles of his cales fo as to appear very bright and fhining, but after the mortal ftroke, his fplendor became much diminifhed, this is likewife the cafe of many of our fnakes. The north fide of the Hill is not ftony as the fouth, but yet very poor. Thence we traveled 7 miles over feveral hollows, fwamps and fmall ridges, full of ferubby bufhes, and ftill poor and ftoney to the laft great ridge, which is compofed chiefly of large gravel, as big as pidgeons or pullets eggs, and even the rocks feemed but heaps of the fame materials; the defcent on the north fide is very fteep and rocky, large craggy rocks are difpofed on all fides, moft part of the way down, which brought us to a fine vale, where we lodged by a creek called Saurel, and were grievoufly ftung all night with fmall gnats, fo that I flept very little.</p>,\n    <p className=\"pageText center\">The 7<sup>th</sup>, we let out weft from Saurel creek and traveled down the vale, which is pretty good land: and leaving the creek, foon croffed another runing along the north fide of the vale, by the bank of which we rode through a grove of white Pine, very lofty and fo clofe, that the Sun could hardly fhine through; at the end of this the two branches joined. Riding a little farther, we paffed through a gap of a moderate hill, north by the creek fide, where we found a fifhing place, moftly a deep hole near a rock ; there we went weft on the north fide of the creek, and dined at what is called the Double Eagle. The land hereabouts is middling white oak and huckleberry land, and by the creek fides pretty good wild graft, and the 2d branch enters about 30 rood below; having croffed this, we went up a vale of middling foil, covered with high oak Timber, nearly weft to the top of the hill, (moft of the way being a white clay under a fhallow furface), where we firft obferved the impref- fion of fhells in fome of the loofe ftones, and from whence we had a fair profpect of the river Sufquehanah.<br /> <br />The defcent from hence foon brought us to Mohony, our lodging for this night. Here the foil is very good throughout the neck, formed by the river and the creek, which is about 3     poles wide. It rained this night through our old, thoâ€™ newly erected lodging, which was an Indian Cabin that we took the liberty to remove, knowing they ufually leave behind them a good flock of fleas on the ground they inhabit; however, the wet deprived me of my reft that I had taken fo much pains to fecure againft the vermin.</p>,\n    <p className=\"pageText center\">July 8. We croffed the creek and rode along a rich bottom near the river for two miles, producing moft kinds of our foreft trees, and a large fpecies of Scutelaria two feet high: thence along the river fide, near a mile N. 20 deg. E. to the foot of a fertil hill, where leaving the river our way N. E. though feveral narrow valleys and over small hills, generally middling land, yielding oak, hickery, chefnut, and fome pine, to the fummit of a high hill, where we faw Shamokin Hill, diftant four miles only; going down we came to uneven fony ground producing pitch pine and oak, as far as the point of Shamokin Hill, whence we had a pleafant profpect of the fall of the river, quite crofs without any great Rocks. The ftream runs very fwift, but canoes or flat-bottomed boats may go up or down well enough: the bottom of this defcent is wafhed by Shamokin Creek three rods wide, this we forded to a fruitful bottom half a mile wide, beyond which two miles good oak land brought us to the town of Shamokin. It contains eight cabbins near the river's bank right oppofite the mouth of the weft branch that interlocks with the branches of Allegheny. It is by means of this neighbourhood that we may reafonably hope, when thefe parts fhall be better known, that a very beneficial Trae may be extended through the Hokio into the Miffiffippi and its branches among the numerous nations that inhabit their banks. It wew to be withed, that the Englifh government in thefe parts had been more diligent in fearching and furveying the heads of their own rivers and he fources of the others that run weftwards from the backs of their refective provinces. Yet enough is already known to juftify the furmifes of Mr. de la Sale, who in his Journal addreffed to the Count de Frontenac expreffes his fears, left the Englifh, from their fettlements, fhould poffefs themfelves of the trade on the Miffiffippi. I quartered in a trader's cabbin, and about midnight the Indian came and called up him and his fquaw, who lay in a separate part of the goods were depofited, whether together or no I did not ask. She fold the Indian rum, with which being qickly intoxicated, men and women began firft to fing and then dance around the fire; then the women would run out to other cabbins and foon return, leaving the men finging and dancing the war dance, which continued all the next day. An Englifhman when very drunk will fall faft afleep for the moft part, but an Indian, when merry, falls to dancing, running, and fhouting, which violent action probably may difperfe the fumes of the liquor, that had he fat ftill or remained quiet, might have made him drowfy, and which it even carries of by continued agitation.<br /> <br />As foon as we alighted they fhowed us where to lay our baggage, and then brought us a bowl of boiled fquathes cold; this I then thought poor entertainment, but before I came back I had learnt not to defpife good Indian food. This hofpitality is agreeable to the honeft fimplicity of ancient times, and is fo punctully adhered to, that not only what is already dreffed is immediately fet before a traveller, but the moft preffing bunifets is poftponed to prepare the beft they can get for him, keeping it as a maxim that he muft always be hungry, of this we found the good effects in the fleth and bread they got ready for us.</p>,\n    <p className=\"pageText center\"> July 9, After breakfast Lewis Evans and myfelf went to the point of the mountain clofe to the N.E. branch, a mile and a half up the river from our lodging, and good level rich land all the way; we walked thither, carrying our blankets with us, and flept near three hours. Here we regulated our journey, and having taken a pleafant view of the range of mountains, and the charming plane of Shamokin, 2 miles long and above one broad, skirted on the Weft and North by the river, and encompaffed Eaft, and partly South, with lofty hills, befides a fine vale bordering the North Weft branch, we returned to the town and fined. In the afternoon we borrowed a canoe, and paddled up the Weft branch. It is near two-thirds as broad as the North Eaft or main river: I went afhore on the fouth fide to the point of a hill to look for curiofities, but found none; the rock confifted of a dark colored thelly ftone: Then we diverted our felves with fwimming, the water was chin deep moft of the breadth, and fo clear one might have feen a pin at the bottom. At night I hung up my blanket like a hammock, that I might lay out of the reach of the fleas,  troublefome and conftant guefts in an Indian hut; but I found my contrivance too cool for a place open on all fides, tho covered with a kind of granary, efpecially the wind blowing cold from the N. W.</p>,\n    <p className=\"pageText center\"> 10. We departed in the morning with Shickalamy and his fon, he being the chief man in the town, which confifted of Delaware Indians; he was of the fix nations, or rather a Frenchman, born at Montreal, and adopted by the Oneidoes, after being taken prifoner; but his son told me he was of the Cayuga nation, that of his mother, agreeable to the Indian rule Partus fequitur ventrem, which is as reafonable among them as among cattle, fince the whole burthen of bringing up falls on her; therefore in cafe of feparation the children fall to her thare.<br /> <br />We had many advantages from the company of thefe guides, were perfectly acquainted with that part of the country, and being of the fix Nations they were both a credit and protection; and, alfo as we went to accommodate the differences, and allay the Heart-burnings that had been raifed by a late skirmish on the back of Virginia between fome of thefe nations and the Englifh, we could not but derive a confidence from the company of a chief.<br /> <br />We coafted the river near a mile to the ford, where we had a good bottom not above 3 feet deep; this brought us to an Ifland near 2 miles long and a quarter broad, pretty rich at the lower end, and near the river, but the higher end fandy, from the drifted left there by the floods, it therefore produces little but pitch pine. After leaving the lower end where we faw feveral cabbins, we once more took water for the oppofite fhore, but the bottom is lefs even, though not above half as wide as the laft, which is about 400 yards.<br /><br />Hence leaving the weft branch about half a mile on our left, and rich low ground between with gravel, oak and pintch-pine land on our right, we reached a pretty fpring of good water, fituated between the fwamp and dry ground. This, fince our paffage over the Blue Mountain was the only one we met with till we came near Onondago, for on that fide the currents and creeks are chiefly formed by the water oufing and draining from the bottoms of the mountains and hills, and are gradually collected in this manner into rivulets. But on the fouth of this great ridge, it gufhes out between the rockets in ftreams big enough to turn a mill, in other places rifing and bubbling out of the earth in quantity fuufficient to fill a pipe an inch fquare, or thereabout.<br /> <br />Our journey now lay through very rich bottoms to a creek 6 miles from Shamokin, a great extent of fruitful low ground ftill continuing. Here we found a fine meadow of grafs on our right, and rich dry ground on the left. In our path lay a large Rattle fnake, but he civilly crept into the grafs, and let us pafs without danger. Our way from hence lay through an old Indian field of excellent foil, where there had been a town, the principal footfteps of which are peach-trees, plumbs and excellent grapes. A great flood came down this branch a few years paft, and drove abundance of fand over this ground a great depth among the trees. It rofe 20 feet perpendicular, wathing away many yards of the bank, which was compofed of gravel and fand, and doubtlefs had been raifed to that heighth by former inundations, for the wood ground 30 rod from the river is feveral feet lower than the bank; a little above this devaftation we dined.<br /> <br />And now leaving the river we held a new courfe over a fine level, then down a rich hollow to a run, where we faw a fummer duck; and fo down the run, a little beyond this turns a path to Wiomick, a town on the eaft branch, hence N. N. E. then N. after W. to a rich bottom near the river, where Shickcalamy formerly dwelt, at the upper end of which reffftlefs torrents had carried abundance of fand into the woods. With this bottom we left the river for the prefent, and kept a variable courfe through the gap of the mountain N. and N. W. over middling champion land, producing fome pitch pine, and large white and black oak, fome fwamps and brooks, by one of which we lodged in a fertile valley, that we reached before night.</p>,\n    // <p className=\"pageText center\"> </p>,\n]\n\n\nexport default Book","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport Book from \"./Book/pages\"\nimport \"./Etext.css\";\nimport { Container, Header, Icon, Pagination } from 'semantic-ui-react'\n\nclass Etext extends Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = { activePage: 1 };\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\n\n\t}\n\n\thandlePaginationChange = (e, { activePage }) => {\n\t\tconsole.log(e);\n\t\tconsole.log(activePage);\n\t\tthis.setState({ activePage })\n\n\t}\n\n\trender() {\n\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div className=\"Etext\">\n\t\t\t\t{/* <Header as='h2' className=\"Etext-Title center\">Observations made by John Bartram.</Header> */}\n\t\t\t\t{this.state.activePage > 1 ? <Header as=\"h2\" className=\"Headers center\"> Day {parseInt(this.state.activePage) - 1} - <a href=\"https://tourbuilder.withgoogle.com/tour/ahJzfmd3ZWItdG91cmJ1aWxkZXJyEQsSBFRvdXIYgIDgmOCh0QoM\">Tour</a> <h2 className=\"center Etext-Title\">Observations made by John Bartram.</h2> </Header> : <br />}\n\n\t\t\t\t<Container fluid className=\"Contents\">\n\t\t\t\t\t{Book[this.state.activePage]}\n\t\t\t\t\t{/* <p className=\"textscript\" style={{overflow: \"auto\"}}>{Book[this.state.activePage]}</p> */}\n\t\t\t\t</Container>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div className=\"centerDiv\">\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<Pagination defaultActivePage={this.state.activePage}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tellipsisItem={{ content: <Icon name='ellipsis horizontal' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfirstItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle double left' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlastItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle double right' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tprevItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle left' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tnextItem={{ content: <Icon name='angle right' />, icon: true }}\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttotalPages={Book.length - 1}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonPageChange={this.handlePaginationChange}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tclassName=\"paging\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t};\n}\n\nexport default Etext;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport { Menu } from 'semantic-ui-react'\nimport \"./NavBar.css\";\n\nexport default class Navbar extends Component {\n\tconstructor(props) {\n\t\tsuper(props);\n\t\tthis.state = { activeItem: 'Home', userLogin: \"Login\" };\n\t}\n\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\n\t\t// \n\t}\n\n\thandleItemClick = (e, { name }) => {\n\t\t// <Redirect><Link /></Redirect>\n\t\treturn window.location.reload();\n\t}\n\n\trender() {\n\t\tconst { activeItem } = this.state\n\t\tconst navBtnColor = \"#bbb\"\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div className=\"NavBar\">\n\t\t\t\t<Menu secondary>\n\t\t\t\t\t{/* <Menu.Item\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname='Home'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactive={activeItem === 'Home'}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t// onClick={this.handleItemClick}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinverted color='teal'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle={{color: navBtnColor}}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t/> */}\n\t\t\t\t\t<Menu.Item\n\t\t\t\t\t\tname='Etext'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactive={activeItem === 'Etext'}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tonClick={this.handleItemClick}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tinverted color='teal'\n\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle={{color: navBtnColor}}\n\n\t\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t{/* <Menu.Menu position='right'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Menu.Item\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tname={this.state.userLogin}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tactive={activeItem === this.state.userLogin}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonClick={this.handleItemClick}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstyle={{color: navBtnColor}}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t</Menu.Menu> */}\n\t\t\t\t</Menu>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./NotFound.css\";\n\nfunction NotFound(props) { \n    return (\n        <div className = \"NotFound\">\n\n            <div className=\"NF-Title\">NotFound</div>\n        </div>\n    ) \n}\n\nexport default NotFound;\n  ","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport Home from \"./Pages/Home/Etext.js\";\nimport NavBar from \"./Components/NavBar/NavBar.js\"\nimport NotFound from \"./Components/NotFound/NotFound.js\";\nimport \"./App.css\";\n\nclass App extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (   \n      <Router>\n        <React.Fragment>\n          <NavBar NavPage={this.AppPage} />\n          <Switch> \n            <Route exact path=\"/observations\"> <Home /> </Route>\n            <Route component={NotFound} />\n          </Switch>\n        </React.Fragment>\n      </Router>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
